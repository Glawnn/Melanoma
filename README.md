# Melanoma

## Description
### What is Melanoma?
Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that develops when melanocytes (the cells that give the skin its tan or brown color) start to grow out of control.

### Neural Network
malignant : harmless tumor
benign : dangerous tumor

## Run the model
For the development I used a gpu which greatly increases the calculation speed.
With just a cpu it's doable but much slower.

You just have to open with vscode and use a notbook extension to run the code.
You can also run it in a jupyter notbook or on the <a>kaggle.com</a> site.
